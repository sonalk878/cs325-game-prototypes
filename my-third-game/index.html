<h2>Joy Hunt</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
    <br/>The game randomness and design is original in my game. I used the inspiration to get an idea of what to do, but I added gems myself and 
    <br/> calculated the pixels of where the pillars should go in the game on my own along with the score and moving screen
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    <br/> What's interessting about my techonology is that I was able to get the screen to extend with the charecter for the game and make the charecter 
    <br/> stop before it reached the end corner. The game has an aspect of luck to it which makes it more interesting becasue the players don't know how
    <br/> high or low the charecter can jump until they actually try. The speed of the charecter is also randomized and is not the same everytime.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
    <br/> I learned  how to expand the screen along with the charecter and also how to do randomized jumps. 
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
   <br/> The hardest part was coming up with an idea of what to make for the game and moving the screen along with the charecter
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
   <br/> The prototype assets were not made from scratch. I used some of the same images from my first digital game and got the platforms off of google. 
</ul>
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
    <br /> Super mario games closely resemble the thought process behind my game. I got my game inspiration from this game: https://pothonprogramming.github.io/content/rabbit-trap/rabbit-trap.html
    <br/>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
    <br/> Collect diamonds and loot in order to acieve the score of 200 and beat the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the themes or challenges you used.
    <br/> The challenge followed was the randomization and I did this through the randomized jumps.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
    <br/> I used keyboard input for this game and the genre was adventure. The play style was adventure. 

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
    <br /> The game mechanic this prototype is evaluating is action/event.

</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
    <br/> I wabt the players to feel a challenge when playing this game. It is difficult to reach all of the platforms due to the randomness of the
    <br/> jumps and the uncertainty that that causes while playing the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
    <br/>The player can use the arrow keys to move the charecter around and get the charecter on the platforms to collect the gems across the board. When the player collects the gems, the score should update and increase overtime.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
    <br/> The players must be observant and quick for this game. In the situation where the player needs to get the charecter to a certain height to reach
    <br/> the platform in order to win, they must be able to quickly retrace backwards in case the player did not jump at the height they were expecting. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
    <br/> The game world is interesting as it is very abseract and there are no patterns followed for the platform placement. The game can be advanced further to have levels and get harder and harder everytime. The game can include some spikes or other barriers to make the game harder for the player overtime. 

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
    <br /> The target audience would most likely be kids around the age of 10 that like challenges in games, but also see results within a short period
    <br /> after they start playing to feel a sense of achievement.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
    <br/> Probably around 5 minutes. 
</li>
