<h2>Math Mania </h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Originality:</strong>
        What is original about your game?
        <br />The assets and the idea are both original about my game.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
        What is interesting about your game technology?
        <br />What's interesting is that i was able to get all three dice and the subtraction symbol rolling at the same time in this game.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
        What did you learn from this prototype?
        What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
        <br />I learned how to make multiple assets work together by making this game. I originally tried to include two player scores and buttons to increment the players scores when they got the math correct, but faced a lot of issues trying to get that to work so I gave up on it:(
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
        Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
        <br /> I created the prototype asset of the middle dice on my own and used google images for the left and right dice
        <ul>
            <li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
        Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
        <br /> The game does not really resemble another game in it's entireety because it is a simple math race game.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>High Concept:</strong>
        A one-sentence summary of your game.
        <br /> Roll the dice and see who can calculate the operation it results in the fastest.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Theme:</strong>
        State which of the themes or challenges you used.
        <br /> No themes were used due to it being optional
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
        State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
        <br />  I included mouse input for this game, indeterministic randomness,puzzle,  and more of a competitor style because the players are competing against one another
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
        What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
        <br />The game mechanic can be considered as roll and move

    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
        What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
        <br /> I want the players to have a good time with their peers while playing this game as they all get to go through with different combinations of the operations and keep them on their toes

    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
        A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
        <br /> In this prototype, the player can perform multiple actions like  addition and subtraction. The first and the last dice are used for the numbers that will be operated against. The middle dice represents the operation that the players need to carry out with the left and right dice. The players would just click on the screen and after the dice are stationary, they will race to see who can finish the operation first. The game could be extended by addind more dice and creating a game board like game style to make the game more interesting

    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Strategies:</strong>
        What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
        <br /> The players should try to remain calm throughout the game because stress can cause the players to fail at the operations 

    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
        A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
        How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
        <br /> The game is set digitally  but the charecters are the actual people playing the game. The game is set in real world and the interesting aspect is that the charecters are in real like representing the conversion between the digital and the real life game aspect. The dramatic tension will build up over the course of the game when the people start getting tensed while playing the game

    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Target Audience:</strong>
        A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
        <br /> This iteration of the game is mostly directed towards people if ages 5 +.

    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Play Time:</strong>
        How long does your game take to play?
    </li>
    <br/>The game takes about 2 - 5 minutes depending how fast the people can go through with the exercises listed.
