<h2>Digital Game Iteration 2</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Originality:</strong>
        What is original about your game?
        <br /> The idea behing the game is original. I thought about the concept of the game and tried to implement it from the idea presented in the analog assignment. The assets of this game are also original. I used the previous iteration to build on it and created more original assets in this version.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
        What is interesting about your game technology?
        <br /> What's interesting about my game is that the results of the game are randomized and not always the same.

    </li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    <br/> From this prototype, I learned that building on a previous iteration of a game is not as easy as I had originally expected. the hardest part of this assignment was trying to randomize the cards of the game. I spent hours researching a way to do this but ultimately decided to give up on the idea. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>The assets were made through my own computer but I did get the background images of the cards and the game itself from google images. /a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br />The game that most closely resembles my game is the previous iteration I made last week. 
</li>

<li>
    <strong>High Concept:</strong>
    A one-sentence summary of your game.
    <br /> Flip over a card from the first row and flip a card from the second row to reveal what action you need to take.

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Theme:</strong>
    State which of the themes or challenges you used.
  <br/>  Themes and challenges were optional, so I did not use any of them for this game.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
    <br /> I included touch and mouse input for this game, determinisic randomness, role-playing game, and more of a performer style because the player is actually going through with the aspects of the game in real life.

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
    What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
    <br/>The game mechanic can be considered as area movement and a bit of matching.
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
    <br /> I want the players to have a good time with their peers while playing this game as they all get to go through with different combinations of exercises and the person that clicks on the most difficult exercise will have trouble going through with the exercise while the rest of the people will enjoy watching the person exercise.

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Gameplay:</strong>
    A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
    <br /> In this prototype, the player can perform multiple actions like  pushups, jumping jacks, and squats. The first two rows contain exercises and the next two rows contain quantities. The players would just click on on card from the top half and one card from the bottom half and go through with the exercise they chose the selected number of times. The game would continue until the cards are compleated. The game could be extended by adding more cards and allowing the numbers and exercises to be randomized

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Strategies:</strong>
    What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
    <br /> The players should try to conserve thier energy throughout the game because they can have a hard time continuing of they use up all of thier strength for one exercise. This will be more of a concern when more cards are added to the game and the players actually have to do more than one exersice.

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
    A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
    How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
    <br /> The game is set digitally  but the charecters are the actual people playing the game. The game is set in real world and the interesting aspect is that the charecters are in real like representing the conversion between the digital and the real life game aspect. The dramatic tension will build up over the course of the game when the people start getting tired playing the game

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Target Audience:</strong>
    A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
    <br /> This iteration of the game is mostly directed towards people if ages 10 +.

</li>

<li>
    <strong>Play Time:</strong>
    How long does your game take to play?
    <br /> The game takes about 2 - 5 minutes depending how fast the people can go through with the exercises listed.

</li>
