<h2>Germaphbe</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
    The idea behind the game is original about my game. I added some music to it and also added some assets that would allow the game to fit better with the theme. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    <br/> What's interesting about my game technology is that it gets mouse input rather than the keyboard input, it is very different from the previous games I have made. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
    <br />I learned how to use mouse input from this prototype and also have an ending screen when the user fails to hit the targets (germs).
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    <br/>The easiest part was inputting the music in the game because I had done that in my previous games. The hardest part was setting the positions of the bricks and making sure they all align. I got a lot of errors trying to make that work. 
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
    <br />I got the assets off of google images and the germ images from this website:https://www.dreamstime.com/illustration/cartoon-virus-germ-bacteria.html. I got the music from this website: https://freesound.org/
   
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
    <br /> I borrowed code from this game: https://ourcade.co/templates/coronavirus-bubble-shooter-template/. The idea behind the game is very similat. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
    <br/>Shoot the soap at the germs and clear them all to be safe and healthy!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the themes or challenges you used.
    <br/>I used the cleaning theme for this game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
    <br/>I used the mouse input, deterministic randomness, collector play style, and shooting genre.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
    <br/> This mechanic is evaluating area movement game mechanic as the mouse moves around and helps the assets cover the area around the screen. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
    <br/>I want the player to experience satisfaction and challenge while playing the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<br/> The palyer can move their mouse around and hit the germs in order to acheive the highest score and beat the game. When the soap droplet hits the germ, the score is increased and the germ that gets hit is removed. The goal of this game is to remove all germs from the screen and win the game!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
    <br/>The player needs to be observant with where the soap droplet is going and quick to react in case the droplet is coming down and the soap bar isn't there to catch it
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
    <br/>The story behind this is that there is a custodian who is assigned to clean up every little germ they could spot with a special tool. The only way they can hit all the germs is by completing the game, otherwise the germs will reapper if the custodian loses. This is very relavent to the current situation the world is in as we all want to be safe and healthy while we're in a pandemic. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
    <br/>I am trying to reach anyone above the age of 5 that can understand the basic concepts behind the game and be able to move the mouse around and beat the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
    <br/>This game would take around 5 minutes to play at an average ( if the player loses and tries again a few times)
