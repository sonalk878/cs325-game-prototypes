<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?</br>
    The display settings are original about my game. The audio added also creates an original aspect to the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    <br />What's interesting is the concept of the game and the potential it has to be made into something more meaningful in the future. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?<br/>
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    I learned that you can change so much about a game by just adding very small features to the game. I found the hardest part to be adding the audio. 
    Still trying to understand if it's my browser that isn't allowing audio to play, or if I just haven't been able to get it to work. 
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
    I made some of the assets from scratch like the background image and the audio, but the rest I borrowed them from a game on phaser already. 
    The link to the game is: https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/firstgame/part9
    <ul>
        <li>Bouncing Phaser image: <a href="https://phaser.io/download/logo">Phaser logo</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>
    <strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
    The game I borrowed code from is https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/games/firstgame/part9
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game. <br/>
    Collect all the gems and win. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
    <br/> I tried to implement the challege given of the found family. The alien is trying to find a sense of family which is why it is on the hunt to look for something to fill the void on earth!

</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
    <br /> Input: keyboard, Randomness: deterministic, Genre: adventure, Play style: Achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
    <br /> The game mechanic this prototype is evaluating is action/event.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
    <br /> I want the player to experience satisfaction when playing the game. I also want them to feel a sense of achivement after collecting all the stars. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
    <br />The player can use thier keyboards to move the game charecter around. All the player needs to do is move the charecter from left, right, up, or down to collect all of the stars. <br/>
    The player will be able to do more with the game as it develops overtime. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
    <br/> Just plain keyboard skills would be effective in playing the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?<br />
    The game is set in the clouds above the surface of the earth. The alien is trying to collect enough information to get closer to the ground. </br>
    The game world is interesting beacuse the idea can be built upon and created into a story mode like game. The tokens can represent how close the alien is getting<br />
    To the surface of the earth.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.</br>
    Little kids that don't really know how to play video games yet. 

</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?</br>
    Less than 2 minutes. 

</li>
