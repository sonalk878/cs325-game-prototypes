<h2>Your Great Escape</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
<br/>I coded the game up myseld using some of the features from a previous iteration. I came up with the design and features of the game such as the assets to use and also the hit box ranges.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
    <br/>What's interesting about my techonology is that I made was able to use a new icon for the charecter and was able to get the hit boxes to align and make the charecter start over automatically when they lost. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
    <br/> I learned how to create hit boxes through this prototype and also finally understand how to change the charecter icons and align them to the background. 
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
    <br/> The harderst part was trying to figure out how to incorporate the features of the game I created earlier into this game. I had to drop a few features like the score and the coins becuase I was't able to figure it out. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
    <li>I did not create my prototype assets from scratch. I got images from google and got the background theme from: https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-castle-tileset</li>
</ul> 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<br/> I got the game inspiration from this website: https://gamedevacademy.org/how-to-make-a-mario-style-platformer-with-phaser-3/
    </li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
    <br/> Avoid all obstacles and make it to the end of the map. 
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the themes or challenges you used.
    <br/> I followed the same theme as the previous iteration of the game I made (Digital Assignment 3) and I changed up a lot about that game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
    <br/>The input is keyboard. Randomness is pretty deterministic. Genre is side-scroller, platformer, and adventure. The play style used is achiever and explorer.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
    <br/> The game mechanic being evaluated is area control and exploration. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototype’s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<br/>The player can use thier keyboard to move the charecter aroumd. The arrow keys corrospond to the direction the charecter will go to and the space bar can also be used to make the player jump. The player must avoid the spikes on the map and on the floor in order to win. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
    <br/>The player needs to be aware of the surroundings and patient if they keep losing. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
    <br/>The player is a newly released game console and is trying to escape from the crowd that is chasing it as it is the last of it's type left on the market. The console is just trying to explore the world and doesn't want to get stuck in a home. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
    <br/>Younger audience new to gameplay. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
    <br/> Around 2-4 minutes
</li>
